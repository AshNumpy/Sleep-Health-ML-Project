<h2 align="center"> Sleep Quality & Stress Level</h2>

### Project Overview
This project includes the analysis of sleep health and lifestyle dataset and an application for predicting stress levels using machine learning.

The dataset consists of 400 rows and 13 columns, encompassing various demographic, health, and lifestyle variables.

### Project Objectives
The main objectives of the project are to analyze and visualize the data related to health, lifestyle, and demographic factors, derive actionable insights from the visualizations, and predict stress levels of individuals using machine learning techniques.

### Project Features
- Sleep health metrics analysis: Explore factors related to sleep duration, quality, and regularity.
- Lifestyle factors analysis: Investigate physical activity levels, stress levels, and BMI categories.
- Cardiovascular health analysis: Examine blood pressure and resting heart rate measurements.
- Sleep disorder analysis: Determine the presence of sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep apnea.
